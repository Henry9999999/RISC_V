How to run code
before runnign please make sure the following are installed on environment
1. iverilog can be found from from https://github.com/steveicarus/iverilog 
2. GTKwave can be downloaded for free at https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/

Before to begin to run the processor we must initialize the instruction memory with the instructions that we want to execute. 
in the register file.

Once the above initializations finished please compile the "Processor_tb.v" using iverilog using the following command:

```
iverilog -o gen-compiled "Processor_tb.v"
```
The above command generates  "gen-compile". After compilation we can execute the compiled file using:
* execution

```
vvp gen-compiled
```
and thats it to see waveform plesas open the gtkwave free viewer and  please find "output_wave.vcd"
 Use GTKWave to view the waveform file

```
gtkwave output_wave.vcd
```
